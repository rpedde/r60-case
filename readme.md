# r60-case #

Case design for a cnc milled cases for the following boards:

* [r60-std](https://github.com/rpedde/r60-std) generic 60%
* [r68](https://github.com/rpedde/r68) 68% like tada or sabre
* [numpad](https://github.com/rpedde/numpad)  a numpad board

Generally, run ```build.py r68``` to build a case for r68.
This creates a number of stl and dxf files.

This is still a work in progress, I'll document the build
strategy I used at some point.
